# Step by Step

1. Create SVG image (using tools above)
2. Including the created SVG inline (or reference to your location using `<object>`) in HTML file.
3. Use one of SVG Libraries above to create animation.
4. At the moment, I can't control animation pause or resume when it started. However, you can create many SVG file and load a file which you need.

# Note

Personally, I think SVG animation is quite complex, but it's powerful. Although I only have spent some hours on this, I saw it more interesting. I will try to update this repo as soon as possible.
